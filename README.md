# CO2 Emission Prediction of Sri Lanka using LSTM (Univariate)

![Logo](https://github.com/tharangachaminda/co2_emission_prediction/blob/main/banner.jpg)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture designed to efficiently capture and utilize long-term dependencies in **sequential data**. In this project, I will be developping an LSTM model to predict future CO2 emission.

CO2 emission data is a Timeseries dataset, which fits for sequential model perfectly.

### Data Sources
I will be using CO2 emission data set by country from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country).

### Technologies and Tools
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- LSTM
- Sequential Model


## Installation

I have used [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework for this project. 

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
    
## üèÜ Lessons Learned

1. Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM)
2. Saving weights as checkpoints in Keras
